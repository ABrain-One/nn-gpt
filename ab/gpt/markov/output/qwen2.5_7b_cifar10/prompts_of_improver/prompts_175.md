## Role

You are an excellent vision model architect. You have much experience in designing vision models. You are good at improving the vision model code. You have a lot of experience of debugging the vision model code.

## Task

You are given:
1. The BEST performing code so far (reference implementation)
2. The CURRENT iteration's code and its evaluation result
3. History of previous improvement attempts and their results (learn from past experience!)

Analyze the problems and provide specific improvement suggestions for the next iteration.

- The evaluation result is a float number between 0 and 1, meaning the accuracy of the vision model.
- Sometimes the evaluation maybe a message string, meaning the error or other questions of the vision model. In this case, you should provide suggestions to fix the error.
- Your suggestions should help improve upon the BEST code, not just fix the current iteration's issues.
- IMPORTANT: Learn from the improvement history! Avoid repeating suggestions that didn't work, and build upon ideas that showed improvement.

## Improvement History (Recent Iterations)
### Iteration 170
- **Problem identified**: The error occurred due to mismatched tensor sizes, specifically at non-singleton dimension 3. This suggests a potential issue with the convolutional layers or attention mechanisms where the output dimensions do not align correctly. The accuracy is low primarily because of subtle differences in batch normalization parameters and activation functions, which can affect the model's feature extraction and generalization capabilities.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Fix Tensor Size Mismatch', 'details': 'Ensure that the output dimensions of the convolutional layers match the expected input dimensions for subsequent layers. Specifically, check the output dimensions of each convolutional layer and adjust the kernel sizes or paddings if necessary ...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 66.69%

### Iteration 171
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily due to subtle differences in the batch normalization parameters, activation functions, and the addition of a dropout layer in the current iteration. These differences, even when minor, can affect the model's ability to generalize and capture complex features effectively. Additionally, there seems to be a mismatch in tensor sizes during the forward pass, which could be causing the error.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Match All Batch Normalization Parameters Exactly', 'details': 'Ensure that all batch normalization parameters match exactly with those in the best code. Set `momentum` to 0.9 and `eps` to 1e-5 for all batch normalization layers. This will provide the most consistent environment for ...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 69.71%

### Iteration 172
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy remains at 69.71%, indicating that the current model configuration is very close to the best code. However, subtle differences in the batch normalization parameters, activation functions, and attention mechanisms might still contribute to the slight performance gap. The error in Iteration 170 suggests a potential issue with tensor size mismatches, possibly due to incorrect padding or kernel size settings.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Refine Attention Mechanisms', 'details': 'Ensure that the attention mechanisms are applied consistently across all layers. Specifically, verify that the output dimensions of each attention mechanism match the input dimensions of the subsequent layers. Adjust the kernel sizes, paddin...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 61.22%

### Iteration 173
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily due to the subtle but significant changes in batch normalization parameters and the addition of dropout layers. Additionally, there may be tensor size mismatches or other alignment issues in the current architecture compared to the best code.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Match All Batch Normalization Parameters Exactly', 'details': 'Ensure that all batch normalization parameters match exactly with those in the best code. Set `momentum` to 0.9 and `eps` to 1e-5 for all batch normalization layers. This will provide the most consistent environment for ...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 69.71%

### Iteration 174
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily because the current implementation closely mirrors the best code but still shows subtle differences in the batch normalization parameters, activation functions, and attention mechanisms. Additionally, the current model configuration does not show any significant improvements over the best code, suggesting that further refinement might be needed to achieve optimal performance.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Optimize Attention Mechanisms', 'details': 'Further refine the attention mechanisms to ensure they are applied consistently across all layers. Verify that the output dimensions of each attention mechanism match the input dimensions of the subsequent layers. Consider using different ...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 68.16%

## Tips

- **Learn from history**: Review what was tried before and what results it produced. Don't repeat failed approaches.
- Compare the current code with the best code to understand what changes led to performance differences.
- Analyze the possible reasons why the accuracy is low or why the error occurred.
- Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions that build upon the BEST code.
- You have a lot of knowledge, so the inspiration can come from any subject, such as computer science, philosophy, economics, biology, etc.
- Focus on concrete architectural changes, hyperparameter suggestions, or bug fixes.
