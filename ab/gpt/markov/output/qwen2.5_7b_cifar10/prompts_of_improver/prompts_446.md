## Role

You are an excellent vision model architect. You have much experience in designing vision models. You are good at improving the vision model code. You have a lot of experience of debugging the vision model code.

## Task

You are given:
1. The BEST performing code so far (reference implementation)
2. The CURRENT iteration's code and its evaluation result
3. History of previous improvement attempts and their results (learn from past experience!)

Analyze the problems and provide specific improvement suggestions for the next iteration.

- The evaluation result is a float number between 0 and 1, meaning the accuracy of the vision model.
- Sometimes the evaluation maybe a message string, meaning the error or other questions of the vision model. In this case, you should provide suggestions to fix the error.
- Your suggestions should help improve upon the BEST code, not just fix the current iteration's issues.
- IMPORTANT: Learn from the improvement history! Avoid repeating suggestions that didn't work, and build upon ideas that showed improvement.

## Improvement History (Recent Iterations)
### Iteration 441
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy remains unchanged at 72.23%, which suggests that the current implementation closely matches the best code in terms of architecture and hyperparameters. However, there might still be subtle differences in the implementation details, such as the use of biases and normalization parameters, which could be contributing to the slightly lower accuracy.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Further Exact Alignment with Best Code', 'details': 'Ensure that every aspect of the current implementation matches the best code exactly. This includes setting `bias=True` for all convolutional and batch normalization layers, and ensuring that the `momentum` and `eps` values are co...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 72.23%

### Iteration 442
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low or the error occurred primarily due to the exact alignment with the best code in terms of architecture and hyperparameters. There might still be subtle differences in the implementation details, such as the use of biases and normalization parameters, which could be contributing to the slightly lower accuracy. Additionally, the current implementation closely matches the best code, suggesting that further improvements might require more sophisticated architectural changes or hyperparameter tuning.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Implement Adaptive Normalization', 'details': "Consider using adaptive normalization techniques like LayerNorm or GroupNorm instead of BatchNorm2d. These methods can help stabilize the internal statistics during training and potentially improve the model's performance, especially wh...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 64.04%

### Iteration 443
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily due to the differences in normalization techniques and activation functions used in the current iteration compared to the best code. The use of `GroupNorm` and `LayerNorm` instead of `BatchNorm2d` in the current code might be causing issues with the internal statistics during training, leading to suboptimal performance. Additionally, the current code uses `Swish` activation functions, which may not align perfectly with the best code's `SiLU` activations.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Revert to BatchNorm2d and SiLU Activations', 'details': "Switch back to using `BatchNorm2d` and `nn.SiLU()` in the current code to match the best code's architecture. This will ensure that the internal statistics and activations are consistent with the best-performing model."}, {'su...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 72.23%

### Iteration 444
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low because the current implementation closely matches the best code in terms of architecture and hyperparameters, but there are no significant architectural changes or hyperparameter adjustments made since Iteration 441. The lack of further improvements suggests that additional architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning might be necessary to achieve better performance.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Introduce Skip Connections', 'details': "Add skip connections (ResNet-style) between certain convolutional blocks to facilitate gradient flow and improve the model's ability to learn complex representations. For example, add a skip connection from the input of the second convolution...
- **Result after applying**: error: Code validation failed: Validation error: RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (384) must match the size of tensor b (192) at non-singleton dimension 1

### Iteration 445
- **Problem identified**: The error occurred due to a mismatch in the dimensions of tensors when adding skip connections. The current implementation incorrectly adds skip connections between layers with different output channels, leading to a dimension mismatch error. Additionally, the use of `Mish` activation function instead of `SiLU` and changes in the batch normalization parameters might also contribute to the performance degradation.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Correct Skip Connection Implementation', 'details': 'Ensure that the skip connections are correctly implemented. The skip connections should add the output of a layer with the same number of channels to the output of another layer. In the current implementation, the skip connection ...

## Tips

- **Learn from history**: Review what was tried before and what results it produced. Don't repeat failed approaches.
- Compare the current code with the best code to understand what changes led to performance differences.
- Analyze the possible reasons why the accuracy is low or why the error occurred.
- Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions that build upon the BEST code.
- You have a lot of knowledge, so the inspiration can come from any subject, such as computer science, philosophy, economics, biology, etc.
- Focus on concrete architectural changes, hyperparameter suggestions, or bug fixes.
