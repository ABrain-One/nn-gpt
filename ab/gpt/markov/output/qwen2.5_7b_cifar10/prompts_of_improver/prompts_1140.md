## Role

You are an excellent vision model architect. You have much experience in designing vision models. You are good at improving the vision model code. You have a lot of experience of debugging the vision model code.

## Task

You are given:
1. The BEST performing code so far (reference implementation)
2. The CURRENT iteration's code and its evaluation result
3. History of previous improvement attempts and their results (learn from past experience!)

Analyze the problems and provide specific improvement suggestions for the next iteration.

- The evaluation result is a float number between 0 and 1, meaning the accuracy of the vision model.
- Sometimes the evaluation maybe a message string, meaning the error or other questions of the vision model. In this case, you should provide suggestions to fix the error.
- Your suggestions should help improve upon the BEST code, not just fix the current iteration's issues.
- IMPORTANT: Learn from the improvement history! Avoid repeating suggestions that didn't work, and build upon ideas that showed improvement.

## Improvement History (Recent Iterations)
### Iteration 1135
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low and the error occurred primarily due to the absence of residual connections and attention mechanisms, which are present in the best code. Additionally, the current code does not match the best code in terms of the number of output channels and the presence of batch normalization layers, which could lead to suboptimal feature learning and performance.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Incorporate Residual Connections and Attention Mechanisms', 'details': 'Add residual connections and attention mechanisms as in the best code. This will help in capturing long-range dependencies and enhancing feature representation. For example, add residual connections after each c...
- **Result after applying**: error: Code validation failed: Validation error: RuntimeError: Given groups=1, weight of size [192, 192, 1, 1], expected input[2, 3, 32, 32] to have 192 channels, but got 3 channels instead

### Iteration 1136
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low and the error occurred primarily due to the incorrect application of residual connections and attention mechanisms, which leads to dimension mismatches and unexpected behaviors. The current implementation introduces a redundant multiplication operation within the forward pass, which is not aligned with the original design in the best code. This mismatch causes the runtime error during the forward pass, indicating that the input channels do not match the expected dimensions.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Correct Application of Residual Connections and Attention Mechanisms', 'details': 'Revert the application of the attention mechanism within the forward pass to match the best code. Instead of multiplying the output of the convolutional layer with the attention map, directly add the ...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 72.38%

### Iteration 1137
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is still 72.38%, which means there might be subtle differences in the architecture or implementation that prevent further improvement. The current code closely follows the best code, but slight variations in the forward pass implementation, such as the way residual connections and attention mechanisms are applied, could be contributing factors. Additionally, the error during the forward pass suggests a mismatch in dimensions, indicating potential issues with the way operations are being performed.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Optimize Residual Connections and Attention Mechanisms', 'details': 'Ensure that the residual connections and attention mechanisms are applied consistently and correctly. Specifically, review and adjust the way these mechanisms are integrated into the forward pass to match the best ...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 72.38%

### Iteration 1138
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy remains at 72.38%, suggesting that the current implementation closely follows the best code but still lacks subtle improvements that could enhance performance. The issue may stem from minor implementation details or potential inefficiencies in the forward pass, particularly in how residual connections and attention mechanisms are applied.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Optimize Residual Connections and Attention Mechanisms Further', 'details': 'Review and refine the way residual connections and attention mechanisms are integrated into the forward pass. Ensure that the addition of residual connections and multiplication by attention maps are perfor...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 72.38%

### Iteration 1139
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low because the current implementation closely mirrors the best code but may still suffer from subtle inefficiencies or misalignments in the application of residual connections and attention mechanisms. The error messages suggest potential dimension mismatches or incorrect operations, which could be due to the way these components are integrated into the forward pass.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Consistent and Correct Integration of Residual Connections and Attention Mechanisms', 'details': 'Ensure that the residual connections and attention mechanisms are applied consistently throughout the network. Specifically, review and standardize the way these components are integrat...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 72.38%

## Tips

- **Learn from history**: Review what was tried before and what results it produced. Don't repeat failed approaches.
- Compare the current code with the best code to understand what changes led to performance differences.
- Analyze the possible reasons why the accuracy is low or why the error occurred.
- Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions that build upon the BEST code.
- You have a lot of knowledge, so the inspiration can come from any subject, such as computer science, philosophy, economics, biology, etc.
- Focus on concrete architectural changes, hyperparameter suggestions, or bug fixes.
