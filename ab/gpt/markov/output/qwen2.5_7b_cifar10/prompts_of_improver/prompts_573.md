## Role

You are an excellent vision model architect. You have much experience in designing vision models. You are good at improving the vision model code. You have a lot of experience of debugging the vision model code.

## Task

You are given:
1. The BEST performing code so far (reference implementation)
2. The CURRENT iteration's code and its evaluation result
3. History of previous improvement attempts and their results (learn from past experience!)

Analyze the problems and provide specific improvement suggestions for the next iteration.

- The evaluation result is a float number between 0 and 1, meaning the accuracy of the vision model.
- Sometimes the evaluation maybe a message string, meaning the error or other questions of the vision model. In this case, you should provide suggestions to fix the error.
- Your suggestions should help improve upon the BEST code, not just fix the current iteration's issues.
- IMPORTANT: Learn from the improvement history! Avoid repeating suggestions that didn't work, and build upon ideas that showed improvement.

## Improvement History (Recent Iterations)
### Iteration 568
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low and the error occurred primarily due to the incorrect handling of tensor dimensions, particularly in the attention mechanisms. This issue stems from the necessity to manage tensor dimensions correctly to ensure compatibility with the expected input formats for the attention mechanisms. Additionally, the current implementation does not fully leverage the residual connections and attention mechanisms as effectively as the best code, leading to suboptimal performance.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Correct Tensor Dimension Handling for Attention Mechanisms', 'details': 'Ensure that the multi-head attention mechanisms accept 3D tensors directly without unnecessary permutations. Specifically, reshape the input tensors to 3D tensors before passing them into the attention mechanis...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 72.36%

### Iteration 569
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low and the error occurred primarily due to the incorrect handling of tensor dimensions, particularly in the attention mechanisms. This issue stems from the necessity to manage tensor dimensions correctly to ensure compatibility with the expected input formats for the attention mechanisms. Additionally, the current implementation does not fully leverage the residual connections and attention mechanisms as effectively as the best code, leading to suboptimal performance.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Optimize Attention Mechanisms', 'details': 'Refine the attention mechanisms by ensuring that the input tensors are correctly shaped and compatible with the expected dimensions. Specifically, ensure that the `query`, `key`, and `value` tensors are reshaped to 3D tensors before passin...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 72.36%

### Iteration 570
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily due to the incorrect handling of tensor dimensions, particularly in the attention mechanisms, and the model does not fully leverage residual connections and attention mechanisms as effectively as the best code. Additionally, there might be subtle differences in hyperparameters and architectural choices that contribute to the suboptimal performance.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Enhance Attention Mechanisms', 'details': "Implement more sophisticated attention mechanisms such as additive attention or scaled dot-product attention. These mechanisms can provide more flexible and powerful ways of capturing dependencies between elements in the input. For example,...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 68.99%

### Iteration 571
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low because the current implementation uses additive attention mechanisms instead of the self-attention mechanism used in the best code. Additionally, the current implementation has unnecessary residual connections and does not fully leverage the attention mechanisms as effectively as the best code. The model also does not use batch normalization in the fully connected layers, which can lead to suboptimal performance.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Switch to Self-Attention Mechanisms', 'details': 'Replace the additive attention mechanisms with self-attention mechanisms. Use the `nn.MultiheadAttention` module and ensure that the input tensors are correctly shaped to handle 3D or 4D tensors appropriately. This will allow the mod...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 10.00%

### Iteration 572
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily due to the incorrect handling of tensor dimensions, particularly in the self-attention mechanisms, and the model does not fully leverage the attention mechanisms as effectively as the best code. Additionally, the current implementation uses unnecessary permutation operations to convert 4D tensors to 3D tensors and back, which can disrupt the flow of data and introduce numerical instability.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Refactor Attention Mechanisms to Directly Handle 4D Tensors', 'details': 'Modify the self-attention mechanisms to directly process 4D tensors without converting them to 3D tensors. This will eliminate the need for permutation operations and streamline the data flow. Specifically, up...
- **Result after applying**: error: Code validation failed: Validation error: AssertionError: query should be unbatched 2D or batched 3D tensor but received 4-D query tensor

## Tips

- **Learn from history**: Review what was tried before and what results it produced. Don't repeat failed approaches.
- Compare the current code with the best code to understand what changes led to performance differences.
- Analyze the possible reasons why the accuracy is low or why the error occurred.
- Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions that build upon the BEST code.
- You have a lot of knowledge, so the inspiration can come from any subject, such as computer science, philosophy, economics, biology, etc.
- Focus on concrete architectural changes, hyperparameter suggestions, or bug fixes.
