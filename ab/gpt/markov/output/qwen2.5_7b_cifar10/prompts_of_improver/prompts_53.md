## Role

You are an excellent vision model architect. You have much experience in designing vision models. You are good at improving the vision model code. You have a lot of experience of debugging the vision model code.

## Task

You are given:
1. The BEST performing code so far (reference implementation)
2. The CURRENT iteration's code and its evaluation result
3. History of previous improvement attempts and their results (learn from past experience!)

Analyze the problems and provide specific improvement suggestions for the next iteration.

- The evaluation result is a float number between 0 and 1, meaning the accuracy of the vision model.
- Sometimes the evaluation maybe a message string, meaning the error or other questions of the vision model. In this case, you should provide suggestions to fix the error.
- Your suggestions should help improve upon the BEST code, not just fix the current iteration's issues.
- IMPORTANT: Learn from the improvement history! Avoid repeating suggestions that didn't work, and build upon ideas that showed improvement.

## Improvement History (Recent Iterations)
### Iteration 48
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is high and matches the best code, but subtle differences in implementation parameters might still introduce minor inefficiencies or inconsistencies that prevent further gains in accuracy. The current architecture closely mirrors the best code, suggesting that any improvements would require fine-tuning of parameters or exploring alternative architectures.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Explore Alternative Architectures', 'details': 'Consider introducing alternative architectures, such as adding residual connections or using a different sequence of operations (e.g., changing the order of convolutions and batch normalizations). For example, you could experiment with...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 65.31%

### Iteration 49
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is high and matches the best code, indicating that the current model is well-optimized. However, there might still be minor inefficiencies or inconsistencies that are preventing further gains in accuracy. These could be related to the specific implementation details and parameter settings.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Fine-Tune Learning Rate Schedule', 'details': 'Implement a more sophisticated learning rate schedule, such as cosine annealing or a step decay, to ensure that the model continues to learn effectively throughout training. This can help in avoiding premature convergence and allow the ...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 36.47%

### Iteration 50
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low due to the presence of redundant dropout layers and inconsistent application of dropout, which likely disrupts the flow of information through the network and leads to suboptimal learning. Additionally, the dropout layers in the current code are applied inconsistently, leading to a potential mismatch with the best code where they are not present.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Remove Redundant Dropout Layers', 'details': 'Since the best code does not include dropout layers, remove all dropout layers from the current code. This will ensure that the model learns more robust features directly without the interference of random unit dropout. If dropout is nec...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 65.01%

### Iteration 51
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low compared to the best code primarily due to the consistent application of dropout layers and the absence of any architectural changes beyond fine-tuning existing components. The dropout layers in the current code are redundant and inconsistent with the best code, which does not include them. This inconsistency disrupts the flow of information and may lead to suboptimal learning, resulting in a lower accuracy.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Remove Redundant Dropout Layers', 'details': 'Since the best code does not include dropout layers, remove all dropout layers from the current code. This will ensure that the model learns more robust features directly without the interference of random unit dropout. If dropout is nec...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 65.01%

### Iteration 52
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low because the current code includes redundant dropout layers, which disrupt the flow of information through the network and lead to suboptimal learning. Additionally, the architecture is identical to the best code, which means that further improvements would require fine-tuning existing components or exploring alternative architectures, but the recent attempts to do so did not yield significant improvements.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Refine the Architecture', 'details': "While the current architecture closely mirrors the best code, consider making subtle adjustments to the architecture to see if there are any improvements. For instance, you could explore adding or modifying residual connections to enhance featur...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 65.31%

## Tips

- **Learn from history**: Review what was tried before and what results it produced. Don't repeat failed approaches.
- Compare the current code with the best code to understand what changes led to performance differences.
- Analyze the possible reasons why the accuracy is low or why the error occurred.
- Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions that build upon the BEST code.
- You have a lot of knowledge, so the inspiration can come from any subject, such as computer science, philosophy, economics, biology, etc.
- Focus on concrete architectural changes, hyperparameter suggestions, or bug fixes.
