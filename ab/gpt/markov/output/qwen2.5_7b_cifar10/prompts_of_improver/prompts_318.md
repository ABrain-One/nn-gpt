## Role

You are an excellent vision model architect. You have much experience in designing vision models. You are good at improving the vision model code. You have a lot of experience of debugging the vision model code.

## Task

You are given:
1. The BEST performing code so far (reference implementation)
2. The CURRENT iteration's code and its evaluation result
3. History of previous improvement attempts and their results (learn from past experience!)

Analyze the problems and provide specific improvement suggestions for the next iteration.

- The evaluation result is a float number between 0 and 1, meaning the accuracy of the vision model.
- Sometimes the evaluation maybe a message string, meaning the error or other questions of the vision model. In this case, you should provide suggestions to fix the error.
- Your suggestions should help improve upon the BEST code, not just fix the current iteration's issues.
- IMPORTANT: Learn from the improvement history! Avoid repeating suggestions that didn't work, and build upon ideas that showed improvement.

## Improvement History (Recent Iterations)
### Iteration 313
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily due to the differences in the convolutional layer sizes and the potential inefficiencies in the model architecture. The current iteration uses larger kernel sizes for the first convolutional layer, which can lead to information loss and reduced feature extraction capabilities. Additionally, the model architecture closely follows the best code but lacks some fine-tuned optimizations and integrations, such as those seen in the attention mechanisms and residual connections.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Adjust Convolutional Kernel Sizes', 'details': 'Reduce the kernel size of the first convolutional layer from 5x5 to 3x3 to better capture local features while maintaining computational efficiency. This change can help in retaining more spatial information and improving feature extra...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 69.96%

### Iteration 314
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily due to the changes in batch normalization parameters and the way residual connections and attention mechanisms are integrated. The current implementation uses different momentum and epsilon values in batch normalization, which may have introduced additional complexity and instability into the model. Additionally, the current code does not perfectly match the best code in terms of the implementation details of residual connections and attention mechanisms.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Revert Batch Normalization Parameters to Original Values', 'details': "Revert the batch normalization parameters to their original values used in the best code, i.e., momentum=0.8 and eps=1e-5. This will help in stabilizing the training process and potentially improve the model's pe...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 65.38%

### Iteration 315
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily due to the addition of spatial dropout layers, which might be overregularizing the model and introducing unnecessary noise. Additionally, there is a slight mismatch in the architecture and the sequence of operations compared to the best code, which could be causing the performance drop.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Remove Spatial Dropout Layers', 'details': 'Remove the spatial dropout layers (`dropout1`, `dropout2`, `dropout3`) as they might be overregularizing the model and introducing unnecessary noise. This simplification can help the model focus more on learning meaningful features from th...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 70.15%

### Iteration 316
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy is low primarily because of subtle differences in the implementation of residual connections and attention mechanisms, which can lead to minor but significant performance drops. Additionally, the current implementation slightly diverges from the best code in terms of the exact order and integration of these components, which might contribute to the observed accuracy drop.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Consistent Residual Connection Implementation', 'details': "Ensure that residual connections are consistently implemented across all layers. In the best code, residual connections are added to the output of the attention mechanism, multiplied by the attention map, and then added to ...
- **Result after applying**: accuracy: 70.15%

### Iteration 317
- **Problem identified**: The accuracy remains unchanged at 70.15%, indicating that the current implementation is already very close to the best code. However, there are subtle differences in the implementation of residual connections and attention mechanisms that might be causing minor but significant performance drops. Additionally, the current implementation lacks some optimizations seen in the best code, such as consistent handling of residual connections and attention mechanisms.
- **Suggestion given**: [{'suggestion': 'Ensure Consistent Handling of Residual Connections', 'details': "In the best code, residual connections are always added to the output of the attention mechanism, multiplied by the attention map, and then added to the input. Ensure that this exact pattern is followed in the current ...

## Tips

- **Learn from history**: Review what was tried before and what results it produced. Don't repeat failed approaches.
- Compare the current code with the best code to understand what changes led to performance differences.
- Analyze the possible reasons why the accuracy is low or why the error occurred.
- Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions that build upon the BEST code.
- You have a lot of knowledge, so the inspiration can come from any subject, such as computer science, philosophy, economics, biology, etc.
- Focus on concrete architectural changes, hyperparameter suggestions, or bug fixes.
