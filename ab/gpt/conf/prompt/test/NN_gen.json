DO NOT ADD NEW METHODS, PARAMETERS, OR EXTERNAL STRUCTURES \n\n – Do not introduce any new helper methods, training tricks, optimization strategies, or external changes to training or data processing logic.\n\n - Your modifications must be strictly confined to the architecture defined in the model class.",
