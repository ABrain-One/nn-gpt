# LLM-Based Neural Network Generator

<h3>Overview ðŸ“–</h3>

This Python-based project leverages large language models to automate the creation of neural network architectures, streamlining the design process for machine learning practitioners.

## Installation of the Latest Version of the NN-Dataset
The NN-Gen project relies on the NN-Dataset. The most recent version of the NN-Dataset can be installed directly from GitHub:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-dataset --upgrade --force
```

## Environment for NN-Gen Developers
### Pip package manager
Create a virtual environment, activate it, and run the following command to install all the project dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Docker
All versions of this project are compatible with <a href='https://hub.docker.com/r/abrainone/ai-linux' target='_blank'>AI Linux</a> and can be run inside a Docker image:
```bash
docker run -v /a/mm:<nn-gen path> abrainone/ai-linux bash -c "PYTHONPATH=/a/mm python -m ab.gen.train_n_eval"
```
